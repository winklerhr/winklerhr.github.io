title: "About Me"
---

My name is Halley and I'm a junior mathematics majors at Appalachian State University. My passions include pure math and community service but I hope to find a career somewhere in the data science field. Outside of class I spend my time as a lead sales associate at Dollar General. When I'm not at work or class I enjoy scary movies, sewing clothes for old figurines, gardening, and playing with my ferret.
