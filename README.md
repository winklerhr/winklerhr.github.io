I'm just changing this README file because I have to change the README file. This project was about me making my own webpage, but if you're reading this you probably already know that. Thought about making myself a fanpage in github for all of my adoring followers but then I remembered my only fan is my dog and he hasn't figured out how to use search engines. I think if I typed the url in for him though and put some peanut butter on the mousepad he might end up subscribing to the webpage and maybe putting in his credit card info if I'm lucky. His credit card is my credit card though so I guess I'd be paying myself and I'm too poor to do that. Anywhose I hope if you see this you like my website and I'll let you know if the dog thing works out.https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/s/615092aa7001edd1d8d70/files/GitRepos/winklerhr.github.io/IMG_20190121_150503_416.jpg
